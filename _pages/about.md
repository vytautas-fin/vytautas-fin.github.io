#### My main research interests:

* Bayesian methods
* Monte Carlo methods (MCMC, SMC, ABC)
* Time series analysis (especially state space models)
* Data analysis (including rare event estimation)
* Machine learning (e.g. Bayesian optimisation)

Besides, I am interested in code optimization, deep learning and adaptive importance sampling.
